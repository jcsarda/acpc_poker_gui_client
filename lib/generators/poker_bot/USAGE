Description:
  Creates a poker bot class with the given name, run command, and arguments.

Example:
  rails generate poker_bot agent_name execute_command arguments

  This will create:
    A poker agent runner class with the name RunAgentNameBot in lib/bots. The execute_command should be the command used to run the agent without any arguments (so if the agent is on a local machine, it would likely be "./relative/path/to/agent_name" (with quotes); on a remote machine, it would likely be "ssh /absolute/path/to/agent_name". The list of arguments must be in the same order as those required by the agent's run command. When using the class, it will take as argument a hash table and will expect values corresponding to those argument names (in Symbol form).
    
    The agent's run command will be saved in the class constant EXECUTE_COMMAND and the list of arguments will be saved in ARGUMENTS. The agent class will have a single class method run_command, which will try to execute EXECUTE_COMMAND with the given argument hash converted into a string in the order provided by ARGUMENTS.
    
    In order for the bot to be available to play against, it must be registered in the ApplicationDefs module (lib/application_defs.rb), which requires associating the bot's name and it's runner class to the ACPC game definitions that it can play, within the GAME_DEFINITIONS hash. For instance, if you wanted to associate an agent called 'UAlberta2012' which corresponds to the bot runner class RunUAlberta2012Bot that you created with this generator, to the 2-player no-limit game, you would add the key-value pair 'UAlberta2012' => RunUAlberta2012Bot to GAME_DEFINITIONS[:two_player_nolimit][:bots].
    
    Also, NewGameController#create (see app/controllers/new_game_controller.rb) will attempt to generate the
    bot's run command when it is selected, so be sure to check that it is adding the required key-value pairs to the run_command argument hash. Arbitrary key-values pairs can be added to this hash (provided there are no duplicate keys) in NewGameController because bot runner classes will ignore pairs they do not need.

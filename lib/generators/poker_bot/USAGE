Description:
   Creates a poker bot class with the given name, run command, and arguments.

Example:
   rails generate poker_bot agent_name execute_command arguments

   This will create:
      A poker agent runner class with the name RunAgentNameBot in lib/bots. The
      execute_command should be the command used to run the agent without any
      arguments (so if the agent is on a local machine, it would likely be
      "./relative/path/to/agent_name" (with quotes); on a remote machine,
      it would likely be "ssh /absolute/path/to/agent_name". The list of
      arguments must be in the same order as those required by the agent's
      run command. When using the class, it will take as argument a hash table
      and will expect values corresponding to those argument names
      (in Symbol form).
      
      The agent's run command will be saved in the class constant
      EXECUTE_COMMAND and the list of arguments will be saved in ARGUMENTS.
      The agent class will have a single class method run_command, which will
      try to execute EXECUTE_COMMAND with the given argument hash converted into
      a string in the order provided by ARGUMENTS.
      
      In order for the bot to be available to play against, it must be
      registered in the ApplicationDefs module (lib/application_defs.rb), which
      requires adding the bot's name and it's runner class to the
      REGISTERED_BOTS constant hash. For instance, if you wanted to add an agent
      called 'UAlberta AAAI bot' which corresponds to the bot runner class
      RunAaaiBot that you created with this generator, you would add the
      key-value pair 'UAlberta AAAI bot' => RunAaaiBot to REGISTERED_BOTS.
      
      Also, NewGameController#create
      (see app/controllers/new_game_controller.rb) will attempt to generate the
      bot's run command when it is selected, so be sure to check that it is
      adding the required key-value pairs to the run_command argument hash.
      Arbitrary key-values pairs can be added to this hash (provided there are
      no duplicate keys) in NewGameController because bot runner classes will
      ignore pairs they do not need.

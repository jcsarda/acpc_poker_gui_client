ACPC Poker Gui Client
======================
The [Annual Computer Poker Competition][ACPC homepage] Poker Gui Client provides a graphical user interface with which people may play poker games against automated agents. It is still under development, but currently supports two-player limit and no-limit Texas Hold'em, and has the potential to support three-player as well.

* [GitHub][ACPC Poker GUI Client GitHub] - Code
* [Documentation][documentation] - Documentation

Components
------------
Much of this application's functionality comes from component gems that began as part of this project and subsequently branched away to become stand-alone projects:

* [ACPC Dealer][ACPC Dealer GitHub] - Wraps the [<em>ACPC Dealer Server</em>][ACPC competition server] in a handy gem with a convenient runner class, and a script for compiling and running the dealer and example players.
* [ACPC Dealer Data][ACPC Dealer Data GitHub] - Utilities for extracting information from [<em>ACPC Dealer Server</em>][ACPC competition server] logs. Used for mostly for testing.
* [ACPC Poker Basic Proxy][ACPC Poker Basic Proxy GitHub] - Utilities for communicating with the [<em>ACPC Dealer Server</em>][ACPC competition server].
* [ACPC Poker Match State][ACPC Poker Match State GitHub] - Provides a manager for the state of a poker match.
* [ACPC Poker Player Proxy][ACPC Poker Player Proxy GitHub] - Provides a full proxy through which a match of poker may be played with the [<em>ACPC Dealer Server</em>][ACPC competition server]. Match states sent by the dealer are retrieved automatically whenever they are available, and are interpreted and managed for the user.
* [ACPC Poker Types][ACPC Poker Types] - Fundamental poker types like `Card`, `Player`, `GameDefinition`, and `MatchState`.

Prerequisites
----------------

* A compatible *\*NIX*-based operating system. Has been successfully installed on *Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS*, *11.04*, *12.04*, and *Mac OS X Lion*. *Windows* is not supported (in this case, it is recommended to run a compatible operating system as a virtual machine in [VMWare Player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
* Ruby 1.9.3 - This can be installed in different ways, but a good choice is [RVM][RVM homepage]. Or you can follow these [instructions][Ruby downloads] to install via a different method.
* Git - While this should only be required if you want to install Ruby via [RVM][RVM homepage], installing Git also makes working with this repository easier, so it is recommended. Follow these [instructions][Git setup] to do so.
* [Bundler][Bundler homepage] - Bundler is a Ruby gem that manages a project's gem dependencies. It requires zlib, which can be installed through [RVM][RVM homepage] by running
    
        rvm pkg install zlib
Once Ruby is installed, installing Bundler should only be a matter of running

        gem install bundler

* A non-LLVM version of GCC - This may require some extra steps on OSX as some versions of XCode no longer include such compilers. There are many [discussions on solutions for this on stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8032824/cant-install-ruby-under-lion-with-rvm-gcc-issues).

Installation
---------------
Download [the code][ACPC Poker GUI Client GitHub], which can be done by running

    git clone git://github.com/dmorrill10/acpc_poker_gui_client.git

Next, download a [<em>MongoDB</em>][MongoDB downloads] version compatible with your system, unpack the compressed file to `<project root>/vendor`, and rename the resulting directory to `mongoDB`.

then, in the project's root directory, run

    bundle install
    rake install

This should install most of the application's dependencies, except [<em>Apache</em>][Apache homepage], including gems and [<em>Beanstalkd</em>][Beanstalkd homepage], and will complete the MongoDB setup.


Non-gem dependencies
---------------------------
The [<em>Beanstalkd background process server</em>][Beanstalkd homepage] is used to host background processes. Background processes are required so that game state can persist beyond a single HTTP request.

[<em>MongoDB</em>][MongoDB homepage] is used as the database back-end.

Web server
--------------
### Development mode
A Thin server installed via gem serves the application locally in development mode.

### Production mode
An [<em>Apache server</em>][Apache homepage] hosts the application proper in production mode. This is currently done with Apache-Rails integration through [<em>Phusion Passenger</em>][Phusion Passenger homepage]. As [Apache][Apache homepage] is only used in production, it is not required to deploy this application on a local development server.

Deployment
------------
### Development mode
Deploying the application in development mode on a Thin server is simply a matter of running

    rake start_dev_server
in the project's root directory.

### Production mode
Similarly, to deploy in production mode (given that [<em>Apache</em>][Apache homepage] and [<em>Phusion Passenger</em>][Phusion Passenger homepage] are properly configured), run:

    rake start_prod_server

Updates
---------
Updating this application can be done by running

    rake update
in the project's root directory, which will pull the newest down code from the [repository][ACPC Poker GUI Client GitHub] and install any missing gems.

These tasks can be done separately too (as can all rake tasks, see Rakefile for more details), with [Git][Git homepage] and [Bundler][Bundler homepage] commands.


Generators
------------

This project includes custom generators:

* poker_bot
* scss_class

For execution details, run

    rails g <generator name> --help

For more information, see this [tutorial][Rails generators tutorial] on [_Rails_][Rails] generators.
